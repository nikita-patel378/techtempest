##About the project
This project creates an automated approach to sending messages to whatsapp for announcements and reminder purposes. The launchtemplate and plistemplate python scripts create a plist file to control scheduling on a Macbook. Taskmessage.py is the python script that uses the pywhatkit library to send the whatsapp messages.
